Description: C library for interacting with Linux PWM devices - development files
 This library allows one to drive Linux PWM devices from userspace.
 Traditionally this is done using files in `/sys/class/pwm`. This lib also
 supports an character device interface. Both ABIs are supported transparently.
 .
 This package contains the static variant of that library and the development
 headers.

Description: C library for interacting with Linux PWM devices - shared library
 This library allows one to drive Linux PWM devices from userspace.
 Traditionally this is done using files in `/sys/class/pwm`. This lib also
 supports an character device interface. Both ABIs are supported transparently.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library.

Description: Simple tools manipulating Linux PWM devices
 The tools included here (pwmset, pwmround, pwmtestperf) are test tools mainly
 used during development and testing of Linux PWM drivers. But if you just want
 to make an LED blink, these are useful, too.
