# This file will be automatically evaluated and installed at next boot
# time, and regenerated (to avoid leaking passwords and such information).
#
# To force it to be evaluated immediately, you can run (as root):
#
#     /usr/sbin/bbbio-set-sysconf
#
# You can disable the file evaluation by disabling the bbbio-set-sysconf
# service in systemd:
#
#     systemctl disable bbbio-set-sysconf
#
# Comments (all portions of a line following a '#' character) are
# ignored. This file is read line by line. Valid
# configuration lines are of the form 'key=value'. Whitespace around
# 'key' and 'value' is ignored. This file will be _regenerated_ every
# time it is evaluated.
#
# We follow the convention to indent with one space comments, and
# leave no space to indicate the line is an example that could be
# uncommented.
