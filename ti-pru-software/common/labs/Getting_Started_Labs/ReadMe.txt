Getting Started Labs
============================================================

For documentation on the Getting Started Labs, please reference
the Processor SDK Linux documentation, section "PRU-ICSS / PRU_ICSSG"
http://software-dl.ti.com/processor-sdk-linux/esd/docs/latest/linux/Foundational_Components_PRU-ICSS_PRU_ICSSG.html

The PRU Getting Started Labs apply to the PRU on AM335x, AM437x, AM57xx, and
AM65xx.

The Getting Started Labs demonstrate how to compile PRU firmware that is written
in C, assembly, or mixed C and assembly. Steps are provided for compiling the
firmware from Linux, or from Code Composer Studio (CCS).

The Getting Started Labs also demonstrate how to initialize the PRU from CCS,
another processor core running Linux, another processor core running RTOS, or
another processor core that runs bare metal code (no OS).
