tensorflow (2.0.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * New upstream version 2.0.0 (Oct 2019).
  * Rewrite the buildsystem, which reconstructs the dependency graph
    by parsing the Bazel buildlog, and subsequently generates a Ninja
    build to approximate the original build sequence.
    + Bazel2Json.py: reads build command sequence from raw buildlog
      of bazel, and stores result into a json file.
    + Json2Ninja.py: read build sequence from json file, understand
      each command line and rebuild the dependency graph. It also
      scans the C++ header includes to avoid surprising FTBFS.
  * Build the following 3 shared objects (standard tensorflow v2):
    + libtensorflow_framework.so.2  (foundamental lib)
    + libtensorflow.so.2            (C interface)
    + libtensorflow_cc.so.2         (C++ interface)

  * Create version_info.cc by ninja target instead of patch.
  * Fix installation path for the embedded Eigen3 library.
  + See git history for detailed changes.

    for the upcoming TensorFlow 2.X series.
