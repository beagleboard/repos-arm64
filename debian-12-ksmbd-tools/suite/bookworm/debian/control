Description: cifsd kernel server userspace utilities
 This is an alternative implementation of the CIFS/SMB3 control utilities.
 The ksmbd part is focused on delivering speedy SMB3 file serving performance
 and also supporting features more implemented in kernel-space, like RDMA
 support for SMB Direct. KSMBD doesn't aim to be as comprehensive as well
 known Samba for CIFS/SMB support in user-space but is just focused on the
 performance and kernel feature angle.
 .
 The tools can either be used with the kernel module built separately or
 right from in the Linux kernel.
