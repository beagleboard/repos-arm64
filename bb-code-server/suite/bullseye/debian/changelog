bb-code-server (4.89.0.0-0~bullseye+20240510) bullseye; urgency=low

  * Changed
  * --Updated to Code 1.89.0
  * --Updated to Node 18.18.2
  * Added
  * --trusted-origin flag for specifying origins that you trust but do not control (for example a reverse proxy).
  * --disable-proxy flag. This disables the domain and path proxies but it does not disable the ports panel in Code. That can be disabled by using remote.autoForwardPorts=false in your settings.
