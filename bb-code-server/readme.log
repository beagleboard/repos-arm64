  * Debian Bookworm 12, forced to disable --cert to get code-server to start -> https://github.com/coder/code-server/issues/5162
  * Changed
  * --Updated to Code 1.80.1.
  * Added
  * --trusted-origin flag for specifying origins that you trust but do not control (for example a reverse proxy).
  * --disable-proxy flag. This disables the domain and path proxies but it does not disable the ports panel in Code. That can be disabled by using remote.autoForwardPorts=false in your settings.
