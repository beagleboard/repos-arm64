umtp-responder for Debian
-------------------------

The daemon is at an early stage of development and does not
provide access control by password or build-in sandboxing.

As now, the systemd unit file at /lib/systemd/system/umtp-responder.service
allows r/w access only to /var/lib/umtp

The unit file is not enabled nor started when the package is installed.
