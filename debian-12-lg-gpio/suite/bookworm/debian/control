Package: liblgpio-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: liblgpio1 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: Control GPIO pins via gpiochip devices - static libraries and headers
 The lgpio library is a fully featured library for controlling the GPIO pins
 of the local board. It includes facilities for software PWM, callbacks on
 level change, I2C, SPI, and UART wrappers.
 .
 This package contains the header files needed to use lgpio from C
 applications.
